# five_a_side
Emergency program made with the sole purpose of creating kind-of-equal teams to play five-a-side football.
Stats are relative and are to be updated periodically.

It's overall an awful program but well, that's what you can do two days before the match and among a lecture and the other kek.

# Commit 08/10:
Alright I added a "Team" class that contains the 5 players of a team (well that was quite self explanatory); this way I can switch players internally and get/update the average with way nicer code.
let's face it, the original code was damn awful so this commit was vital more than necessary.
