# five_a_side
Emergency program made with the sole purpose of creating kind-of-balanced teams to play five-a-side football.
Stats are relative and are to be updated periodically.

It's overall an awful program but well, that's what you can do two days before the match and among a lecture and the other kek.

# Commit 08/10:
Alright I added a "Team" class that contains the 5 players of a team (well that was quite self explanatory); this way I can switch players internally and get/update the average with way fancier code.
let's face it, the original code was damn awful so this commit was more vital than necessary.

# Commit 21/10:
Well, now I can make teams of whatever size (guess I should add a couple of exceptions to take care of those odd cases huh). With the last update the user only needs to set the nicknames of the players that will participate and the maximum difference of average between the two teams. Everything works ***provided that the total number of players is even yeah beware of quality coding***.
Oh, though this way the name of the repository becomes obsolete but I'm too lazy to change it for now, so whatever.
